## Hi there

I am a regular tech enthusiast. Although it's overboard to call myself a developer, I love to code and develop.
I developed interest in hacking, high speed typing from childhood.
I love to watch anime, read fantasy light novels.
I am weak at giving presentations and stage talks.

My goal is to achieve a state where I can enjoy every moment of my life.
